## About

This monorepo is the home for all Blockception Minecraft Bedrock development tools, including:

- **Language Server**: Provides rich language features for Bedrock scripting and project files.
- **Diagnostics**: Advanced error checking and validation for Bedrock projects.
- **Project Utilities**: Helpers for managing, building, and validating Bedrock projects.
- **VSCode Extensions**: Editor integration for a seamless development experience.

Our goal is to provide a unified, modern, and extensible toolkit for Minecraft Bedrock creators.

## Monorepo Structure

The repository is organized as a monorepo, containing multiple packages and tools:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/                # Core packages (commands, diagnoser, types, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ ide/                     # Editor integrations (VSCode, shared, base)
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation/           # Guides, API docs, and tutorials
â”œâ”€â”€ resources/               # Assets and shared resources
â”œâ”€â”€ coverage/                # Test coverage reports
â”œâ”€â”€ ...                      # Root configs, scripts, and meta files
```

Each package or tool is self-contained with its own `package.json`, source code, and tests.

## Development Workflow

- **All packages** are managed together. Use root-level npm scripts to build, lint, and test all packages.
- **Individual packages** can be developed and tested in isolation (see their respective `README.md` for details).
- **VSCode extension**: Develop and debug from `ide/vscode`.

### Useful Commands

- `npm run build` â€“ Build all packages
- `npm run lint` â€“ Lint all code
- `npm test` â€“ Run all tests
- `npm run clean` â€“ Clean build artifacts
